During the Phd, I came across [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-main) which is a huge online database for animal tracking data. This type of data, generally gather through a GPS device attached to an animal, which record its coordinate at fixed time point.

Such data can be used to understand animal behaviour and how they move through space. There is a rich litaruture on the topic, and if you are itnerested you can read the book of Hooten et al. ([link](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781315117744/animal-movement-mevin-hooten-devin-johnson-brett-mcclintock-juan-morales)), which is fairly complete dealving into the subject. 

I have the following paper on the subject
