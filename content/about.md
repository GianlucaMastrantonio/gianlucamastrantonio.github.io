Describing myself is never easy, but here goes: I'm a Statistician who's really into Bayesian statistics, particularly from an applied problem-solving and implementation perspective. I work as an associate professor at the Polytechnic of Turin, in the Department of Mathematical Sciences.
If you're curious about my research, check out my
([my institutional webpage](https://www.polito.it/personale?p=041089)), my [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/search/stat?searchtype=author&query=Mastrantonio,+G), 
or my [github page](https://github.com/GianlucaMastrantonio), where you can also find codes related to my published papers. 


I've also created a couple of packages
- [CircSpaceTime](https://github.com/GianlucaMastrantonio/CircSpaceTime): It's an R package I made for analyzing Bayesian spatial circular data. For all the technical details, take a look at this [article](https://doi.org/10.1080/00949655.2020.1725008); 
- [BayesSizeAndShape](https://github.com/GianlucaMastrantonio/BayesSizeAndShape.jl): Here's a Julia package I put together for Bayesian regression models dealing with Size-And-Shape data. If you want to dive deep into the models, have a look at this [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spl.2023.109928).


I'm into music (who isn't, right?), and at the bottom of this page, you can check out a Spotify player with a chunk of the playlist that I listen to when I'm working or just chilling.
I used to play the guitar, but not so much these days.  Occasionally, I compose some electronic music, and I might share some of that here in the future. 

I'm also into video games, reading manga, watching anime, movies, and TV series. I wish I read more books, but for some reason, I hardly ever do.
