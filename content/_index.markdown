# My Blog - Gianluca Mastrantonio (Under Construction) 
  
<!--## _Keep it simple, but not simpler_-->

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Welcome to my personal blog! This is my first attempt at blogging, and I'm embarking on this journey with no clear destination in mind.  If you're curious to learn more about me, my interests, or what I do, you can find that information [here](/about/).


Currently, the website maintains a minimalist design, as I wanted to avoid investing too much time in customization, considering I'm not entirely certain how, and if, I'll utilize this platform. 

At the moment the site is very simple since I didn't want to spend too much time customizing it I don't really know if I'm not going to use it. I hope to be able to add more features and content as I continue to develop the blog. 
 This site is powered by [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and uses the [**XMin** theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) written by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org).
